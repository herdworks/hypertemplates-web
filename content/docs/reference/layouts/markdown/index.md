## Markdown

Markdown is a document format [created by John Gruber] for <mark>writing for the web</mark>.
The markdown syntax was designed to generate HTML from plain text (markdown) documents.
Markdown (and its [many variants]) have become so ubiquitous that it even used to generate formatted text beyond the web (e.g. in messaging platforms like [Whatsapp], [Slack], and [Discord]).

### Learn Markdown

There are far too many excellent resources for learning markdown for us to attempt our own.
Here are a few of our favorites:

* [Markdown Guide](https://ia.net/writer/support/basics/markdown-guide) by @ia.net[^1]
* [CommonMark Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) by @commonmark.org
* [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) by @github.com
* [Working with advanced formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting) by @github.com

### HyperMark

The markdown engine in HyperTemplates is called HyperMark.
HyperMark is based on the [GitHub Flavored Markdown] dialect, and compliant with the latest version of the [CommonMark Specification].

HyperMark also provides support for [HyperMentions] – \@mentions and \#hashtags for the open web.

#### \@Mentions

HyperMark automatically converts \@mentions to links (i.e. `<a>` elements).
A \@mention is a string that begins with the `@` symbol, followed by any combination of alphanumeric, dot (`.`), underscore (`_`), dash (`-`), and forward slash (`/`) characters.
A \@mention must contain at least one dot (`.`) character.

All **\@mention** `<a>` elements generated by HyperMark use the `https://` URL scheme and have a boolean `data-hyper-mention` HTML attribute.

**Example:**

<code-snippet hyper-code filename='index.md'>

```markdown
Powered by @hypertemplates.net!
```

</code-snippet>

**Output:**

```html
<p>Powered by <a href='https://hypertemplates.net' data-hyper-mention>@hypertemplates.net</a>!</p>
```

#### \#Hashtags

HyperMark automatically converts \#hashtags to links (i.e. `<a>` elements).
A \#hashtag is a string that begins with the `#` symbol, followed by any combination of alphanumeric, underscore (`_`), and dash (`-`) characters.
A \#hashtag must contain one non-numeric character (e.g. `#1` is treated as a numeric reference equivalent to "number one", not "hashtag one").

All **\#hashtag** `<a>` elements generated by HyperMark will have relative href values (`/tags/:hashtag`) and have a boolean `data-hyper-mention` HTML attribute.

**Example:**

<code-snippet hyper-code filename='index.md'>

```plaintext
HyperTemplates is a pure #HTML templating system for the modern web.
```

</code-snippet>

**Output:**

```html
<p>HyperTemplates is a pure <a href='/tags/html' data-hyper-mention>#HTML</a> templating system for the modern web.</p>
```
