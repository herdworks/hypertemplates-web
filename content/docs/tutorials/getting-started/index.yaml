            * MacOS

              ```shell
              curl -LO https://preview.hypertemplates.net/downloads/hyperctl_0.10.2_darwin_universal.tar.gz
              tar -xzf hyperctl_0.10.2_darwin_universal.tar.gz
              chmod +x hyperctl
              sudo mv hyperctl /usr/local/bin/
              hyperctl # run hyperctl to verify the installation and see the version number
              ```

              ```shell
              curl -LO https://preview.hypertemplates.net/downloads/hyperctl_0.10.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
              tar -xzf hyperctl_0.10.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
              chmod +x hyperctl
              sudo mv hyperctl /usr/local/bin/
              hyperctl # run hyperctl to verify the installation and see the version number
              ```

            * Windows (coming soon)

              If you're interested in trying out beta releases of HyperTemplates for Windows, please [join the community](https://hypertext.community) and check out [`hyperctl` for Windows](https://hypertext.community/c/hyperctl/windows).

        - title: Create your first HyperTemplates website
          description: Use the `hyperctl new website` command to start a new HyperTemplates project.
          instructions: |
            Start a new HyperTemplates project with the [`hyperctl new website`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/new/website/) command.

            ```shell
            hyperctl new website -b "https://acmeinc.com" -t "Acme Inc" acme-website
            cd acme-website
            ```

            The `hyperctl new website` command provides some basic scaffolding for a new website, including your `site.yaml` configuration file, a landing page, some example layout templates, and more.

            Feel free to explore the generated files in your text editor, or move on to the next step to start the development server and view your new website in a browser.

            Start the HyperTemplates development server with the [`hyperctl server`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/server/) command.

            ```shell
            hyperctl server --config site.yaml
            ```

            Now open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view your new HyperTemplates website!

            Voila! 
            You now have a basic HyperTemplates website up and running, and ready for you to customize and build upon.
